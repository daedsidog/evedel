* Evedel: Instructed LLM programmer/assistant

Evedel is a [[https://github.com/karthink/gptel][gptel]] extension Emacs package specialized for ergonomic programming with an LLM.

Evedel aims to shift the programmer's workload from manually writing code to instead write
instructions for the model on how to write the code.

Evedel can also be used in non-programming buffers.
